* RPMDB

Policy to help manage and maintain your rpm database.

** rpmdb_manage_corruption

The most common repair to rpm errors is cleaning up lock files. When
this policy detects an error while querying the rpm packge database it
cleans up the lock files and rebuilds the database.

** How to integrate into your policy

First get the policy into your masterfiles

#+begin_src sh
  cd /tmp
  export MASTERFILES=/home/nickanderson/CFEngine/masterfiles
  git clone https://github.com/nickanderson/cfengine-rpmdb.git
  cd cfengine-rpmdb
  mkdir -p $MASTERFILES/services/rpmdb
  git archive master | tar -x -C $MASTERFILES/services/rpmdb
#+end_src


Include def.cf in your inputs

#+begin_src cfengine
  body common control
  {
        inputs => {
                    # Reports
                    @(cfengine_reports.inputs),

                   "services/rpmdb/def.cf",

                    # autorun system
                    @(services_autorun.inputs),
        };
  }
#+end_src

I would reccomend using def.json if your running 3.7 or greater
masterfiles

** Activating the policy


#+begin_src cfengine
  bundle agent main
  {
    methods:
      redhat|centos::
        "Mantain RPM DB"
          usebundle => rpmdb_manage_corruption;
  }
#+end_src
